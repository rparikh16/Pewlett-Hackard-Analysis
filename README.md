# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to take raw employee data from Pewlett-Hackard to determine the number of employees close to retirement, which industry sectors those employees are in and if there are enough employees to establish a mentorship program to prepare the company as baby boomers begin to retire at a rapid rate.

## Results

- About 50,000 senior engineers/staff will need to replaced in the next few years which will create large vacancies in highly technical roles if people within the organization do not receive internal promotions and training. 
- There are not enough senior engineers available in the mentorship eligible to effectively prepare for the "silver tsunami" that will begin, many more senior positions will need to filled
- Two manager vacancies are about to come that will need significant experience and training to get filled, which should be a priority
- A fast-track prorgam will need to be initated to promote assistant engineers to engineers and engineers to senior engineer

- There are 72,458 current staff members that were born between 1952 and 1955 that are approaching retirement 
- Out of the 72,458 staff members, there are 25,916 Senior Engineers, 24,926 Senior Staff, 9,285 Engineers, 7,636 Staff, 3,603 Technique Leaders, 1,090 Assisstant Engineers, and 2 Managers 
- There are 1549 current staff born in 1965 that are eligible for the mentorship program, which enables current and new hires training in positions that will need to be filled with the older staff retiring. 
- Out of the 1549 current staff, there are 306 Senior Engineers, 441 Senior Staff, 383 Engineers, 283 Staff, 77 Technique Leaders, 59 Assisstant Engineers, and 0 managers.
- Therefore, each Senior Engineer mentor will need to train 84 people, each Senior Staff mentor will need to train 56 people, each Engineer mentor will need to train 24 people, each Staff mentor will need to train 26 people, each Technique Leader will need to train 46 people, and each Assisstant Engineer mentor will need to train 18 people. 
- It does not look like there are enough senior engineers that are qualified and retirement ready to mentor the next generation, and there are no managers in this list, so that should be a priority at this stage
